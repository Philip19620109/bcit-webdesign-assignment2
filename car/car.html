				<p>The Dream Car Collection post from earlier got me thinking. I'd love to own all kinds of different cars, but if you have so many, would it take away from the feeling of just owning one or two choice cars?</p>
				<p>I have two cars and they are:</p>

				<ul>
					<li>Model: C250 AMG</li>
					<li>Year: 2015</li>
					<li>Color: Silver</li>
				</ul>
				</dt>
				<p>An all-new iteration of the Stuttgart staple. Formerly, the Mercedes C-Class looked a bit conservative, but aimed (and didn’t quite succeed) in matching the way a 3-Series drives. The new one is styled more elegantly, but feels aimed less at hooning about and more at proceeding in great comfort, safety and refinement. Tech includes optional adaptively damped air suspension, a first among its rivals. It feels like a smaller Merc S-Class, and that’s a very good thing.</p>
				<p>The familiar 2.1-litre diesel in the C 220 and C 250 BlueTEC has been fettled for economy and silence, and just mumbles gently while serving useful overtaking performance (although it can get raucous when revved, and isn’t the quietest from cold). The steering gets more direct off-lock and the calibration is terrific. Thanks to the weight cut of 100kg or so, the car never feels bloated. The C isn’t set up to be power-interactive in bends – the attitude is always mild understeer at road speeds – but it’s ultra-faithful and capable. The ride is supple too. OK it pogoes a bit if you nudge the ‘agility control’ switch towards the sporty settings, but you can opt for ‘individual’, and set chassis and powertrain eagerness independently.</p>
				<p>The ultimate C is the C63 S, with an M3-beating 517bhp for 0-62mph in 4 seconds. There’s a lesser 483bhp AMG too, but you have to go full fat. And of course the C is a brilliant cruiser. Driver-assist options use radar, stereo camera and ultrasound to figure out what’s going on all around, further taking the load off the driver. It can look for – and take action to avoid – vehicles, people and other obstacles coming from pretty well any direction except outer space.</p>
				<p>The swish new cabin design is as much of a step ahead as the exterior look, and the quality mostly superb. Seats are great too, and space improved. It looks fantastic and really stands out in this sector. Whatever number of the vast gadgetry options-list you’ve ticked, a screen guides you through it all in a series of slick animations. It’s easy to use too, with a quadruple-redundant layout of a big control-wheel, shortcut keys, voice activation and a touchpad.</p>

				<dt><h1>Honda</h1></dt>
				<ul>
					<li>Model: CR-V Touring</li>
					<li>Year: 2017</li>
					<li>Color: Silver</li>
				</ul>
				<p>The completely redesigned 2017 Honda CR-V could easily have been a case of "If it ain't broke, don't fix it." After all, the outgoing CR-V was still selling at a class-leading clip, so there was no pressing reason to change course. We would have understood if Honda made some superficial design tweaks and called it a day.</p>
				<p>But instead we have the 2017 CR-V, a redo from the ground up that decisively parts ways with its competent but conservative predecessor. The styling has gone from anonymous to awesome, led by an aggressive new front fascia, reshaped rear windows and sculpted haunches that convey a surprising muscularity. For all trims except the base LX, that's backed up under the hood by Honda's excellent 1.5-liter turbocharged four-cylinder engine, first seen in the Civic and a natural fit in the CR-V given its ample low-end torque and fuel-sipping ways — up to 34 mpg highway, according to the EPA.</p>
				<p>Inside, the CR-V again follows the latest Civic's lead with a modernized dashboard, a digitally enhanced instrument cluster and an updated touchscreen that thankfully includes a volume knob. There's also even more rear legroom than before — not that anyone was clamoring for it — and an exceptional 75.8 cubic feet of maximum cargo space that positions the "compact" CR-V as a legitimate alternative to midsize SUVs.</p>
				<p>The 2017 Honda CR-V further benefits from thoroughly overhauled underpinnings that reduce body roll in corners without compromising the historically compliant ride. The wheelbase is longer, the front and rear tracks are wider, and there's even an extra 1.5 inches of ground clearance for those who found that the previous CR-V scraped its stomach too often in light-duty off-roading. Add it all up and you've got a strong contender for best-in-class honors. The CR-V has long been a champ in the sales and sensibility columns, but now it's poised to be a winner on the merits, too.</p>
