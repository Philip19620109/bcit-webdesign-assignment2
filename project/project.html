			<h1>Who am I</h1>
			<p>Have I ever asked myself, ‘What is my true identity?’ Am I a father, a husband, a friend, an engineer, a passenger or a patient? The truth is that I am a father because I have a son. I am a husband because I have a wife. A passenger because I am are on a train. So all my identities, everything I believe myself to be, are all dependent on something else. So then, who am I? A father, a husband or a passenger?</p>
			<p>By not knowing the answer to these questions, I keep on creating new identities of myself, consequently going farther away from my true Self. All the suffering in life is because of not knowing my true identity. Until I realize my true Self, I believe myself to be the name that has been given to me.</p>
			<p>So who am I? In reality I am an eternal Soul. For infinite past lives the Soul has been hidden beneath a veil of ignorance. Due to this, we have been unable to experience the true Self. Thereafter, I not only understand that I am a Pure Soul, but I also experience my true bliss.</p>

			<h1>Where to go</h1>
			<p>Sometimes to find myself, I have to lose myself somewhere along the way. I might feel confident and content with my path one day, but feel totally confused and conflicted the next. The path to the top might look clear one day, but it can easily slip out of view depending on what circumstances I face. All of us have different ways of approaching life, and what makes us feel happy can change drastically from moment to moment. Don’t beat myself up if I don’t know which direction to turn sometimes – this is just a normal part of life. However, I can pull myself out of the trenches and find my way back to the light again whenever I feel lost in life.

					<h4>1. DON’T FIGHT MY FEELINGS</h4>
					<p>First and foremost, I can’t ever climb out of the hole I’ve found myself in if I try to suppress my feelings. To get to know myself again, I have to walk through the darkness – not avoid it. I might not see the point in evaluating my feelings, but to get anywhere in life, I have to become aware of how I feel. my emotions at any given time can tell I a lot about my current situation and can serve as the catalyst for change. So, when I feel lost, go deep within and learn to listen to my feelings. my intuition always serves my highest good – I just have to learn how to tune into it.</p><br><br>
				</div>

				<div id="article-2">
					<h4>2. TRUST MYSELF</h4>
					<p>Secondly, I can’t ever find myself again if I don’t trust both myself and the process of knowing myself. At some point in life, all of us will lose touch with ourselves in some manner. The key to finding ourselves once again, however, is to believe in ourselves and know that we have everything we need in order to thrive. If I turn my back on myself and the faith I have in my abilities, where else will I turn? Remember, the most important relationship I have in life is the one with myself, because I can’t ever run away from I. So, learning how to trust my inner voice and intuition will go a long way in finding myself once again.</p><br>

					<h4>3. REMEMBER TO ENGAGE IN THINGS THAT I ENJOY</h4>
					<p>When I feel lost, try to remember what truly makes I happy. Get outside and get fresh amy, join a gym or yoga studio, work in the garden, or any activity that brings a smile to my face. Simply doing these little things that make our hearts happy can dispel any feelings of hopelessness that might creep up. As humans, we naturally worry about if we’re living “the right way,” but just keep in mind that everything is subjective. There is no rule book to life; we get to create it as we go along. So, it only makes sense then to use our time wisely.</p>
				</div>
				
				<div id="article-4">
					<h4>4. TRY NEW THINGS</h4>
					<p>Feeling lost? Why not shake things up a bit and get out of that boring daily routine? As contradicting as it sounds, I can easily lose myself inside the mundane and familiar. Inside our comfort zones, we can start to lose touch with our spmyit, with what makes us truly come alive. We all need some variety every once in a while, and who knows, maybe by learning a new skill or keeping ourselves occupied with new activities, we can reinvent ourselves and become even better than the person we once knew.</p><br>
